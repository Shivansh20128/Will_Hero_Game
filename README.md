The objective was to replicate the core features and mechanics of the original "Will Hero" game, including player movement, combat, enemy interactions, and scorekeeping.

# Features
1. Player Controls:
The player (hero) can move, jump, and attack using a sword or hammer to combat enemies.

2. Enemy AI:
Enemies have varying levels of power, and the king enemy is the most powerful, usually appearing towards the end of the game.

3. Game Saving:
Implemented the ability to save the game's progress, including the score, number of coins, and acquired weapons.
4. Gameplay Elements:
Incorporates elements such as pits, where the hero can fall and die, and allows collection of coins, treasures, and weapons.

5. Leaderboard:
Includes a leaderboard to store and display the highest scores achieved by players.
